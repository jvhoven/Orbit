## Development setup

If you feel like helping with Orbit, have some great ideas you'd like to implement or have a heads-up I can learn from? Below are the steps to get started. Feel free to comment and/or make a pull request!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jvhoven/orbit.git
cd orbit
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

Also be sure to use the ``webpack.config.js`` in order to have the benefits of the redux devtools. You can do so by editing ``server.js``.

```sh
var config = require('./webpack.config')
```
